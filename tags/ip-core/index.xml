      <description>&amp;quot; Digital devices are the basic building blocks of electronic systems. Such devices are for application-specific devices like a USB controller. But also programmable System-on-Chip are found in embedded systems. Both tastes of a chip are composed of basic building blocks, so called IP (Intellectual Property) cores. A &amp;ldquo;LibreCore&amp;rdquo; is such an IP core that is created and distributed in the open source spirit. And LibreCores.org is like a good neighborhood pub, a place to meet the community and —most importantly— find such cores.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;OpenCores is the most prominent online community for the development of gateware IP (Intellectual Properties) Cores. It is the place where such cores are shared and promoted in the spirit of Free and Open Source collaboration.&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;The OpenCores portal hosts the source code for different digital gateware projects and supports the users’ community providing a platform for listing, presenting, and managing such projects; together with version control systems for sources management.</description>

      <description>PoC - “Pile of Cores” provides implementations for often required hardware functions such as Arithmetic Units, Caches, Clock-Domain-Crossing Circuits, FIFOs, RAM wrappers, and I/O Controllers. The hardware modules are typically provided as VHDL or Verilog source code, so it can be easily re-used in a variety of hardware designs.
All hardware modules use a common set of VHDL packages to share new VHDL types, sub-programs and constants. Additionally, a set of simulation helper packages eases the writing of testbenches.</description>
