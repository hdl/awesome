      <description>&amp;ldquo;The Amaranth project provides an open-source toolchain for developing hardware based on synchronous digital logic using the Python programming language, as well as evaluation board definitions, a System on Chip toolkit, and more. It aims to be easy to learn and use, reduce or eliminate common coding mistakes, and simplify the design of complex hardware with reusable components.
The Amaranth toolchain consists of the Amaranth hardware definition language, the standard library, the simulator, and the build system, covering all steps of a typical FPGA development workflow.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Chisel adds hardware construction primitives to the Scala programming language, providing designers with the power of a modern programming language to write complex, parameterizable circuit generators that produce synthesizable Verilog. This generator methodology enables the creation of re-usable components and libraries, such as the FIFO queue and arbiters in the Chisel Standard Library, raising the level of abstraction in design while retaining fine-grained control.&amp;quot;
 Currently, Chisel (Constructing Hardware in a Scala Embedded Language) is in its version 3 (first commit in 2015).</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Edalize is a Python Library for interacting with EDA tools. It can create project files for supported tools and run them in batch or GUI mode (where supported).&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;All EDA tools such as Icarus, Yosys, ModelSim, Vivado, Verilator, GHDL, Quartus etc get input HDL files (Verilog and VHDL) and some tool-specific files (constraint files, memory initialization files, IP description files etc). Together with the files, perhaps a couple of Verilog defines, some top-level parameters/generics or some tool-specific options are set.</description>

      <description>FuseSoC is a package manager and a set of build tools for HDL code. Its main purpose is to increase reuse of IP cores and be an aid for creating, building and simulating SoC solutions. FuseSoC provides utilities for:
 reusing existing cores creating compile-time or run-time configurations running regression tests against multiple simulators porting designs to new targets leting other projects use your code  References:

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Despite being faster than schematics entry, hardware design with Verilog and VHDL remains tedious and inefficient for several reasons. The event-driven model introduces issues and manual coding that are unnecessary for synchronous circuits [&amp;hellip;]. To address those issues, we have developed the Migen FHDL, a library that replaces the event-driven paradigm with the notions of combinatorial and synchronous statements, has arithmetic rules that make integers always behave like mathematical integers, and most importantly allows the design&amp;rsquo;s logic to be constructed by a Python program.</description>

      <description>See Amaranth HDL.
There is/was a dispute between M-Labs and whitequark about the ownership of the brand nMigen. Most of the codebase of nMigen was written by whitequark and the upstream was nmigen/nmigen. However, there is a fork in m-labs/nmigen and M-Labs claims the brand as being based on Migen (see nmigen.org).  </description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Fundamental design elements are state machines/stateful elements(registers, rams, etc), auto-pipelined stateless pure functions, and interconnects (wires, cdc, async fifos, etc).
By isolating complex logic into autopipelineable functions, and only writing literal clock by clock hardware description when absolutely necessary, PipelineC designs do not need to be rewritten for each new target device / operating frequency. The hope is to build shared, high performance, device agnostic, hardware designs described in a familiar and powerfully composable C language look.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Silice makes it possible to write algorithms for FPGAs in the same way we write them for processors: defining sequences of operations, subroutines that can be called, and using control flow statements such as while and break. At the same time, Silice lets you fully exploit the parallelism and niceties of FPGA architectures, describing operations and algorithms that run in parallel and are always active, as well as pipelines. Silice remains close to the hardware: nothing gets obfuscated away.</description>
