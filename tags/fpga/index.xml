      <description>&amp;ldquo;Edalize is a Python Library for interacting with EDA tools. It can create project files for supported tools and run them in batch or GUI mode (where supported).&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;All EDA tools such as Icarus, Yosys, ModelSim, Vivado, Verilator, GHDL, Quartus etc get input HDL files (Verilog and VHDL) and some tool-specific files (constraint files, memory initialization files, IP description files etc). Together with the files, perhaps a couple of Verilog defines, some top-level parameters/generics or some tool-specific options are set.</description>

      <description>FuseSoC is a package manager and a set of build tools for HDL code. Its main purpose is to increase reuse of IP cores and be an aid for creating, building and simulating SoC solutions. FuseSoC provides utilities for:
 reusing existing cores creating compile-time or run-time configurations running regression tests against multiple simulators porting designs to new targets leting other projects use your code  References:
