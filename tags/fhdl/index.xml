      <description>&amp;ldquo;The Amaranth project provides an open-source toolchain for developing hardware based on synchronous digital logic using the Python programming language, as well as evaluation board definitions, a System on Chip toolkit, and more. It aims to be easy to learn and use, reduce or eliminate common coding mistakes, and simplify the design of complex hardware with reusable components.
The Amaranth toolchain consists of the Amaranth hardware definition language, the standard library, the simulator, and the build system, covering all steps of a typical FPGA development workflow.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Despite being faster than schematics entry, hardware design with Verilog and VHDL remains tedious and inefficient for several reasons. The event-driven model introduces issues and manual coding that are unnecessary for synchronous circuits [&amp;hellip;]. To address those issues, we have developed the Migen FHDL, a library that replaces the event-driven paradigm with the notions of combinatorial and synchronous statements, has arithmetic rules that make integers always behave like mathematical integers, and most importantly allows the design&amp;rsquo;s logic to be constructed by a Python program.</description>

There is/was a dispute between M-Labs and whitequark about the ownership of the brand nMigen. Most of the codebase of nMigen was written by whitequark and the upstream was nmigen/nmigen. However, there is a fork in m-labs/nmigen and M-Labs claims the brand as being based on Migen (see nmigen.org).  </description>
