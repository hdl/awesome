      <description>&amp;ldquo;The Amaranth project provides an open-source toolchain for developing hardware based on synchronous digital logic using the Python programming language, as well as evaluation board definitions, a System on Chip toolkit, and more. It aims to be easy to learn and use, reduce or eliminate common coding mistakes, and simplify the design of complex hardware with reusable components.
The Amaranth toolchain consists of the Amaranth hardware definition language, the standard library, the simulator, and the build system, covering all steps of a typical FPGA development workflow.</description>

      <title>Chisel/FIRRTL Hardware Compiler Framework</title>
      <link>https://hdl.github.io/awesome/items/chisel/</link>

      <guid>https://hdl.github.io/awesome/items/chisel/</guid>
      <description>&amp;ldquo;Chisel adds hardware construction primitives to the Scala programming language, providing designers with the power of a modern programming language to write complex, parameterizable circuit generators that produce synthesizable Verilog. This generator methodology enables the creation of re-usable components and libraries, such as the FIFO queue and arbiters in the Chisel Standard Library, raising the level of abstraction in design while retaining fine-grained control.&amp;quot;
 Currently, Chisel (Constructing Hardware in a Scala Embedded Language) is in its version 3 (first commit in 2015).</description>

      <title>Electronic Design Automation Abstraction (EDA²)</title>
      <link>https://hdl.github.io/awesome/items/edaa/</link>

      <guid>https://hdl.github.io/awesome/items/edaa/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Electronic Design Automation Abstraction (EDA²) is a conceptual model for characterising the abstraction layers in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) projects based on Hardware Description Languages (HDLs). Its goal is the interoperability of diverse tools and languages, through documented interfaces.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;EDA² aims to provide reference Python implementations and schemas of commonly needed software layers for (open source) EDA tooling/frameworks to reduce code duplication and reinventions of existing algorithms and data structures. Each layer solves the problems at a different abstraction level, hence, they are organised as an stack.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;gdsfactory is a python library to design chips (Photonics, Analog, Quantum, MEMs, …), objects for 3D printing or PCBs.
You can describe your hardware in code (python or YAML), verify it (DRC, simulation, extraction) and validate it (to make sure it meets your specifications after fabrication)..&amp;quot;</description>

      <guid>https://hdl.github.io/awesome/items/migen/</guid>
      <description>&amp;ldquo;Despite being faster than schematics entry, hardware design with Verilog and VHDL remains tedious and inefficient for several reasons. The event-driven model introduces issues and manual coding that are unnecessary for synchronous circuits [&amp;hellip;]. To address those issues, we have developed the Migen FHDL, a library that replaces the event-driven paradigm with the notions of combinatorial and synchronous statements, has arithmetic rules that make integers always behave like mathematical integers, and most importantly allows the design&amp;rsquo;s logic to be constructed by a Python program.</description>

      <description>See Amaranth HDL.
There is/was a dispute between M-Labs and whitequark about the ownership of the brand nMigen. Most of the codebase of nMigen was written by whitequark and the upstream was nmigen/nmigen. However, there is a fork in m-labs/nmigen and M-Labs claims the brand as being based on Migen (see nmigen.org).  </description>

      <title>Open Source VHDL Verification Methodology (OSVVM)</title>

      <guid>https://hdl.github.io/awesome/items/osvvm/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;OSVVM is an advanced verification methodology that defines a VHDL verification framework, verification utility library, verification component library, and a scripting flow that simplifies your FPGA or ASIC verification project from start to finish. Using these libraries you can create a simple, readable, and powerful testbench that is suitable for either a simple FPGA block or a complex ASIC.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://hdl.github.io/awesome/items/pipelinec/</guid>
      <description>&amp;ldquo;Fundamental design elements are state machines/stateful elements(registers, rams, etc), auto-pipelined stateless pure functions, and interconnects (wires, cdc, async fifos, etc).
By isolating complex logic into autopipelineable functions, and only writing literal clock by clock hardware description when absolutely necessary, PipelineC designs do not need to be rewritten for each new target device / operating frequency. The hope is to build shared, high performance, device agnostic, hardware designs described in a familiar and powerfully composable C language look.</description>

      <guid>https://hdl.github.io/awesome/items/silice/</guid>
      <description>&amp;ldquo;Silice makes it possible to write algorithms for FPGAs in the same way we write them for processors: defining sequences of operations, subroutines that can be called, and using control flow statements such as while and break. At the same time, Silice lets you fully exploit the parallelism and niceties of FPGA architectures, describing operations and algorithms that run in parallel and are always active, as well as pipelines. Silice remains close to the hardware: nothing gets obfuscated away.</description>
